5. **Improve Tests**

# Fork the repository on GitHub and clone it

cd react-api-search
```

## Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Since the library cannot run as a standalone app, use \`npm link\` to test it in a separate project:

   ```bash
   npm link
   ```

3. In your test project (e.g., a React app where you want to test the library), link the library:

   ```bash
   cd path-to-your-test-project
   npm link react-api-search
   ```

4. Now, import the library in your test project and test the functionality.

5. To unlink after testing:

   ```bash
   npm unlink react-api-search
   ```

6. To run tests:

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

2. **Make your changes**:
   Edit the necessary files, and follow the existing code style and conventions.

3. **Write tests** (if applicable):
